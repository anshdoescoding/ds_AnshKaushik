Trader Behavior Insights – My Submission

Hi! I’m Ansh Kaushik, and this is my work for the Trader Behavior Insights assignment.  
The goal was simple: see if traders behave differently when the market is feeling “Fear” vs “Greed” — and what that means for performance.

**What’s Inside**
- notebook_1.ipynb → Data cleaning, merging the sentiment & trade data, and doing the main EDA.
- notebook_2.ipynb→ Extra analysis: correlations, a simple regression model, and segmenting traders into risk profiles.
- csv_files/→ All the CSV files I generated (processed dataset, segmentation, etc.).
- outputs/ → Charts and visuals from my analysis.
- ds_report.pdf → A short write-up of what I found.

**Quick Summary**
- Traders tended to make slightly bigger trades during “Greed” phases.
- Win rates didn’t change much between Fear and Greed.
- A simple regression didn’t predict PnL well — real trading performance is more complex than a few metrics.

**How to View**

-You can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab using the links I’ll provide in the submission email.  
All CSVs and images are in their own folders so everything stays tidy.

**Tools I Used**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Google Colab

  
**Note on CSV Files**

-GitHub’s file size limit is 25 MB, so three large CSVs are uploaded as zip files.
Extract this zip to access all CSV files.


Thanks for reviewing my work!
